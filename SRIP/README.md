# Morphological Operations : PROCEDURE

The objective of this experiment is to understand the basics of morphological operations which are used in analyzing the form and shape details of image structures.
The experiment contain following type of Morphological operations :
###### 1. Dilation
###### 2. Erosion
###### 3. Closing
###### 4. Opening
The following are the examples of different morphological operatrions performed on the image.

### Dilation :

The experiment is designed to understand and learn the morphological operations in the images.

* Steps to run the experiments -

	1. Select image from the image grid by clicking on it.

	2. Select one option from 'Dilation','Erosion','Closing'and 'Opening'.

	3. Select options from 'Shape' and 'Size' of structuring elements properties.

	4. Select run option to perform the operations.
	
	5. For a fresh start click on the reset button.

	6. For instruction regarding the experiment click on the instruction button.
	
* Interesting Observations -
    1. Select different size of structuring elements and observe the change in final output.
