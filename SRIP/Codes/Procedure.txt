#IMAGE ARITHMETIC : PROCEDURE

The experiment is design to understand and learn the image arithmetic concepts. This experiment consists five parts:

1. Image addition
2. Image Subtraction
3. Image Difference
4. Image Multiplication
5 .Image Division

**STEPS TO RUN THE EXPERIMENT :**

**STEP 1.** Select an image from the images in the image grid.

**STEP 2.** Select secondary image by choosing either of the 'dull' , 'bright' or 'gradient' images.

**STEP 3.** Select one option from 'addition', 'subtraction', 'difference', 'multiplication' and 'division'.

**STEP 4.** Select the one option from 'clipping' and 'auto-scaling'.

**STEP 5.** Select run option to perform the operations.
       Output result will be displayed in the output layer.



**INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS :**

1. Do the Subtraction and Difference operations, and compare the results.
2. Do the Multiplication operation first with clipping and then with auto-scaling, and compare the results.
